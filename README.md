# Setup Decisions
The GoRails web site has a few pages on system setup. They include instrictions for lots of different OS versions. Here is the version for [MacOS 13](https://gorails.com/setup/macos/13-ventura). That includes steps to install different databases (MySql, PostgreSQL).

I decided to keep it simple. I documented the steps I did in this [SETUP](./doc/SETUP.md) documentation

# SQL Database
Sometimes you just want to talk directly to the horses mouth. To me this means interacting with the database. So here are some [SQL Database](./doc/SQL.md) notes.

# Bootstrap
This class uses Bootstrap in .ERB files to create the GUI. The videos often lookup different [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) components on the "Docs" page: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
