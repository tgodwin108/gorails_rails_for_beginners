# Setup Decisions
The GoRails web site has a few pages on system setup. They include instrictions for lots of different OS versions. Here is the version for [MacOS 13](https://gorails.com/setup/macos/13-ventura). That includes steps to install different databases (MySql, PostgreSQL).

I decided to keep it simple. I documented the steps I did in this [SETUP](./doc/SETUP.md) documentation
